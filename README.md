This repository contains solutions for exercises in the Objective Programming Java course.

exercises: https://github.com/Soamid/obiektowe-lab

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

1. [oolab](oolab/): Contains Java labs exercises solutions.
2. [OOKotlin](OOKotlin/): Contains Kotlin additional project solutions.

Each directory has its own build scripts and source code.

## Building and Running

For both directories, you can use the provided Gradle wrapper to build and run the projects:

```sh
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

## Additional Tasks

At the start of the course, we were required to complete Git exercises from https://gitexercises.fracz.com. I successfully completed all of them, and you can find my solutions at https://gitexercises.fracz.com/committer/d79ff243289415ddd10070bd066634fc3d5eb188.
